### NLP Text Data Research

- Motivation
Text data has been a recent challenge for data scientists to research and analyze given its unstructured format and non-numeric feature. It is quite different from the typical numeric or categorical features we encounter more often in data analysis task. The dataset we picked is a merged data source from three data sources, because we want to ensure there are three big topics, that are somewhat different, in order for our clustering algorithm to explore.

[Note]: Alought our dataset only contains two columns, it is confirmed by instructor that it is ok to use, because text data are usually harder to clean and will eventual result in more columns.
